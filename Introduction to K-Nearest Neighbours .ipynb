    "Many machine learning algorithms attempt to find trends in the data by comparing features of data points. However, there is an issue when the features are on drastically different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset of houses. Two potential features might be the number of rooms in the house, and the total age of the house in years. A machine learning algorithm could try to predict which house would be best for you. However, when the algorithm compares data points, the feature with the larger scale will completely dominate the other. Take a look at the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data points on the y-axis range from 0 to 20. Data points on the x-axis range from 0 to 100\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data looks squished like that, we know we have a problem. The machine learning algorithm should realize that there is a huge difference between a house with 2 rooms and a house with 20 rooms. But right now, because two houses can be 100 years apart, the difference in the number of rooms contributes less to the overall difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a more extreme example, imagine what the graph would look like if the x-axis was the cost of the house. The data would look even more squished; the difference in the number of rooms would be even less relevant because the cost of two houses could have a difference of thousands of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of normalization is to make every datapoint have the same scale so each feature is equally important. The image below shows the same house data normalized using min-max normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data points on the y-axis range from 0 to 1. Data points on the x-axis range from 0 to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max Normalization\n",
    "Min-max normalization is one of the most common ways to normalize data. For every feature, the minimum value of that feature gets transformed into a 0, the maximum value gets transformed into a 1, and every other value gets transformed into a decimal between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the minimum value of a feature was 20, and the maximum value was 40, then 30 would be transformed to about 0.5 since it is halfway between 20 and 40. The formula is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    new_value = (value - min)/(max - min)\n",
    " \n",
    "Min-max normalization has one fairly significant downside: it does not handle outliers very well. For example, if you have 99 values between 0 and 40, and one value is 100, then the 99 values will all be transformed to a value between 0 and 0.4. That data is just as squished as before! Take a look at the image below to see an example of this.\n",

    "Almost all normalized data points have an x value between 0 and 0.4\n",

If it is below the mean, it will be a negative number, and if it is above the mean it will be a positive number. The size of those negative and positive numbers is determined by the standard deviation of the original feature. If the unnormalized data had a large standard deviation, the normalized values will be closer to 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the data still looks squished, notice that the points are now on roughly the same scale for both features — almost all points are between -2 and 2 on both the x-axis and y-axis. The only potential downside is that the features aren’t on the exact same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "With min-max normalization, we were guaranteed to reshape both of our features to be between 0 and 1. Using z-score normalization, the x-axis now has a range from about -1.5 to 1.5 while the y-axis has a range from about -2 to 2. This is certainly better than before; the x-axis, which previously had a range of 0 to 40, is no longer dominating the y-axis.\n",

    "Supervised machine learning algorithms are amazing tools capable of making predictions and classifications. However, it is important to ask yourself how accurate those predictions are. After all, it’s possible that every prediction your classifier makes is actually wrong! Luckily, we can leverage the fact that supervised machine learning algorithms, by definition, have a dataset of pre-labeled datapoints. In order to test the effectiveness of your algorithm, we’ll split this data into:\n",

    "        validation set\n",
    "        test set\n",

For example, when using Linear Regression, the points in the training set are used to draw the line of best fit. In K-Nearest Neighbors, the points in the training set are the points that could be the neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training using the training set, the points in the validation set are used to compute the accuracy or error of the classifier. The key insight here is that we know the true labels of every point in the validation set, but we’re temporarily going to pretend like we don’t. We can use every point in the validation set as input to our classifier. We’ll then receive a classification for that point. We can now peek at the true label of the validation point and see whether we got it right or not. If we do this for every point in the validation set, we can compute the validation error!\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation error might not be the only metric we’re interested in. A better way of judging the effectiveness of a machine learning algorithm is to compute its precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How to Split\n",
    "Figuring out how much of your data should be split into your validation set is a tricky question. If your training set is too small, then your algorithm might not have enough data to effectively learn. On the other hand, if your validation set is too small, then your accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score could have a large variance. You might happen to get a really lucky or a really unlucky split! In general, putting 80% of your data in the training set, and 20% of your data in the validation set is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "    N-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "Sometimes your dataset is so small, that splitting it 80/20 will still result in a large amount of variance. One solution to this is to perform N-Fold Cross-Validation. The central idea here is that we’re going to do this entire process N times and average the accuracy. For example, in 10-fold cross-validation, we’ll make the validation set the first 10% of the data and calculate accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. We’ll then make the validation set the second 10% of the data and calculate these statistics again. We can do this process 10 times, and every time the validation set will be a different chunk of the data. If we then average all of the accuracies, we will have a better sense of how our model does on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changing The Model / Test Set\n",
    "Understanding the accuracy of your model is invaluable because you can begin to tune the parameters of your model to increase its performance. For example, in the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, you can watch what happens to accuracy as you increase or decrease K. (You can try out all of this in our K-Nearest Neighbors lesson!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’re happy with your model’s performance, it is time to introduce the test set. This is part of your data that you partitioned away at the very start of your experiment. It’s meant to be a substitute for the data in the real world that you’re actually interested in classifying. It functions very similarly to the validation set, except you never touched this data while building or tuning your model. By finding the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the test set, you get a good understanding of how well your algorithm will do in the real world."

    "The validation accuracy changes as k changes. The first situation that will be useful to consider is when k is very small. Let’s say k = 1. We would expect the validation accuracy to be fairly low due to overfitting. Overfitting is a concept that will appear almost any time you are writing a machine learning algorithm. Overfitting occurs when you rely too heavily on your training data; you assume that data in the real world will always behave exactly like your training data. In the case of K-Nearest Neighbors, overfitting happens when you don’t consider enough neighbors. A single outlier could drastically determine the label of an unknown point. Consider the image below.(in folder)\n",

When k = 1, all points in that general area will be classified as dark blue when it should probably be classified as green. Our classifier has relied too heavily on the small quirks in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if k is very large, our classifier will suffer from underfitting. Underfitting occurs when your classifier doesn’t pay enough attention to the small quirks in the training set. Imagine you have 100 points in your training set and you set k = 100. Every single unknown point will be classified in the same exact way. The distances between the points don’t matter at all! This is an extreme example, however, it demonstrates how the classifier can lose understanding of the training data if k is too big."
